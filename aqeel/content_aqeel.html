        <h2>CONSERVE AND RESTORE TERRESTRIAL AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</h2>
        <p>
          The goal to "Conserve and Restore Terrestrial and Freshwater
          Ecosystems" focuses on preserving and improving the health of land and
          water environments to ensure they continue providing essential
          services to humanity and the planet. By 2020, this objective aimed to
          protect forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands from degradation
          and destruction, thereby maintaining biodiversity and ensuring the
          resilience and functionality of ecosystems. It also emphasized the
          importance of actively restoring damaged ecosystems to a healthy state
          through rehabilitation efforts, such as reforestation and wetland
          restoration, to recover their ecological integrity and services.
          Furthermore, this goal aligned with international obligations,
          underscoring the global commitment to sustainable land and water
          management practices that support both environmental and human
          well-being.

        <h2>END DESERTIFICATION AND RESTORE DEGRADED LAND</h2>
        <p>
          The goal to "End Desertification and Restore Degraded Land" by 2030
          represents a global commitment to combating the deterioration of land
          and soil caused by desertification, drought, and floods. The objective
          extends beyond mere conservation to actively restoring degraded
          landscapes, particularly those affected by environmental stressors.
          This initiative aims to achieve a "land degradation-neutral world,"
          where the balance between land degradation and restoration efforts
          results in a stable or improved land quality globally. To reach this
          goal, strategies include implementing sustainable land management
          practices, promoting reforestation and afforestation, restoring
          degraded ecosystems, and enhancing soil conservation techniques. By
          restoring degraded land and mitigating the impact of desertification
          and drought, societies can protect biodiversity, improve water
          resources, enhance food security, and build resilience against climate
          change impacts. International cooperation and adherence to agreements
          like the UN Convention to Combat Desertification are crucial in
          achieving these ambitious targets, ensuring that future generations
          inherit healthy and productive land ecosystems.

        <h2>ENSURE CONSERVATION OF MOUNTAIN ECOSYSTEMS</h2>
        <p>
          The goal to "Ensure Conservation of Mountain Ecosystems" by 2030
          focuses on preserving the unique and diverse environments found in
          mountainous regions. This includes protecting the biodiversity within
          these ecosystems to maintain their health and resilience. Mountain
          ecosystems are vital as they provide numerous essential benefits such
          as water resources, habitat for unique species, and opportunities for
          tourism and recreation. Conserving these areas is crucial for
          sustainable development because it ensures the continued availability
          of these resources and benefits for future generations. The initiative
          calls for effective management practices and policies that prioritize
          the protection of mountain landscapes, promote sustainable land use,
          and address the impacts of climate change and human activities on
          these fragile environments. By safeguarding mountain ecosystems, we
          can enhance their ability to support the livelihoods of millions of
          people who depend on them and contribute to global ecological balance.
